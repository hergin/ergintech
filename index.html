											<h3>Huseyin Ergin, Ph.D.</h3>
											<!--<p>Posted 45 minutes ago</p>-->
										</header>
										<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Ball State
											University in Muncie, Indiana. My research interests include computer
											science education, software engineering, and model-driven engineering. I
											earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees from the University of Alabama, as well as
											an additional M.Sc. from Sabanci University in Turkey, and a B.Sc. from
											Yeditepe University in Turkey, all in computer science or engineering.
										</p>
										<p>With
											extensive industry experience, I have worked as a software developer in R&D
											departments, IT departments, startups, and manufacturing companies, giving
											me a comprehensive understanding of software development practices in
											various settings. I have also participated in programming, science,
											robotics, idea, startup, and entrepreneurship competitions/events.
										</p>
										<p>Currently, I am actively collaborating with industry partners to research
											software engineering techniques and practices. I have secured over $150,000
											in grant money for software engineering research from industry partners
											under my university position. </p>
										<p>In addition to my research work, I teach
											software engineering classes and supervise software projects for local
											community partners, including startups, non-profit organizations, university
											branches, and local companies. I also founded the Capstone Connector, a
											program under the Innovation Connector of Muncie, which connects industry
											partners with student Capstone teams.</p>
										<p>I love biking, running, ziplining, and skydiving. I have run in a few
											half-marathons and worked at GoApe as ZipLine instructor for sometime.</p>
